# Employee Management System

  ![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
  <br>
  
  This is a Node.js command-line application that a company can use to manage their employee database. 
  
  A user is able to view and add departments, roles, and employees. This application gives the user flexibility to assign specific departments to roles, specific roles to employees, and specific employees as managers. 

 [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) were used to create this application.
